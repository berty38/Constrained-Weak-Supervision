Weak signals will be in the form of (# of training examples, # signals)
    This will have to be transposed for the current set up of Binary ALL

    Binary ALL has three sets –– Dev, Train, Test
    Multi ALL and CLL has 2 sets –– Train, Test
        Dev and Train are combined into one

We can access both probabilities and error bounds of weak signals here
    Not sure about -1, 0, 1 flags

Can choose to pass in a function to generate weak signals

Can pass in datapath to save signal data
